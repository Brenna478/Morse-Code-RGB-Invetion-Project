### Morse-Code-RGB
Houses all documentation for Morse Code RGB Pi Invetion 


## Description: 
Morse code is one of the oldest transmission systems but it is not very accessible to those who listen to the sounds. However, if there is a visual component it not only could be accessible but it could also be a great teaching tool for those who want to learn morse code visually. 

This can be executed via a wired speaker and RGB led bulb connected to the RaspberryPi. The audio needs to be imported by pydub to be used through speaker and then executed by pydub.playback. For the lights it is necessary to import time in order to showcase the length of the sound. The light is connected via male to male cables and a voltage resistor and is coded in a specific RBG code for the light to turn that color when enabled. The code has a specific phrase that it translates into morse code and also visualizes the beeps with the LED. 

## Physical Requirements:
A RaspberryPi (4)
A breadboard with a ribbon cable and T-Cobbler 
5 male to male wires
2 330 Î© (at least) resistor
An RGB LED
A wired speaker
Ability to open the code on the Raspberry pi
